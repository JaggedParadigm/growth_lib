## Calculating exponential-culure dilution volumes 
This code calculates the volume of exponentially growing culture at a particular concentration to add to a known volume of fresh medium such that the desired cell concentration of that new culture should occur at a particular time the next day.

The idea is to catch the final culture at the exact window you would like to monitor it at and not stay in lab incredibly late, sleeping under your desk, waking up every hour or so to check whether it is time cry ... I mean take a sample.

I've included two notebooks: 1) That dealing with the theory of exponential growth modeling and 2) An example using the code.
