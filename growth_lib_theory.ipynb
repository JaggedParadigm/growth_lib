    "We want to know what volume, $V_a$, of exponentially growing culture at concentration, $C_m$, to add to a volume, $V_m$, of fresh media such that the desired optical density, $C_f$, should be acheived at a particular time the next day. \n",

This can quickly become too laborious. Thus, it is more efficient to target the use of an exponential culture volume that is negligible relative to that already placed in the flasks. \n",
